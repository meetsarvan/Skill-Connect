# SkillConnect

**SkillConnect** helps job seekers and companies find each other using structured skill-based profiles. 

Job‑seekers sign up and build a clear profile—contact info, education, projects, skills, work history, and what they’re looking for—and then browse or filter job and internship listings that match them.

Companies sign up, add their locations and contacts, post openings with the exact skills, dates, salary, and contract details they need, and can also search profiles to reach out directly.

By keeping everything structured and in one place, SkillConnect makes it easy for both sides to find the best match and stay on the same page through every step of the hiring process.
